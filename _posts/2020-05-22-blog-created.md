Welcome!

I have started my blog.

It is powered by Jekyll and Markdown.

A little bit about me, I am joining a startup as a software engineer in Toronto. Previously, I was an analytics consultant at a Canadian bank and a management consultant at a professional services firm.

You can contact me via email: [zoubinirani@gmail.com](mailto:zoubinirani@gmail.com).

Special thanks to Jonathan McGlone's [guide and template!](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/"), it made the process of starting this blog much easier.
